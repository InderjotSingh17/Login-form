Django Login Dashboard with SQL Database Integration
Welcome to the Django Login Dashboard Project! This project features a simple login system, a user-friendly dashboard, and a secure authentication mechanism. It is connected to an SQL database (MySQL) where user credentials are stored securely.

🚀 Features
Login System: Users can authenticate with their username and password.

Dashboard: After logging in, users are redirected to a clean and minimalistic dashboard.

Logout: Users can easily log out with a single click.

Database Integration: The project uses MySQL for storing user credentials securely.

Error Handling: Displays appropriate error messages for failed login attempts.

Secure Authentication: Utilizes Django's built-in authentication system to manage sessions and protect sensitive information.

🛠 Tech Stack
Backend: Django (Python)

Database: MySQL

Frontend: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap)

Authentication: Django's built-in authentication system

Deployment: Local development using Django development server

⚙️ How It Works
Login: The user enters their username and password. If authentication is successful, the user is redirected to the dashboard.

Dashboard: Once logged in, users see a personalized welcome message on the dashboard with a logout button.

Logout: Users can log out by clicking the logout button, which ends the session and redirects them to the login page.

🛡️ Security Features
Password Hashing: Passwords are securely hashed before being stored in the database.

Session Management: Django’s built-in session management ensures that the user’s login session is securely handled.

Error Handling: Users are shown an appropriate error message if the login fails due to incorrect credentials.

🔄 Future Enhancements
Add user registration and email verification.

Implement password recovery/reset functionality.

Improve the dashboard with additional features like user profile, activity tracking, etc.

Enhance UI/UX with modern frontend frameworks like React or Vue.js.
